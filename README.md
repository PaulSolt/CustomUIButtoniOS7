Custom UIButton on iOS7
==================

The project demonstraits how to create a custom UIButton on iOS 7.0 that will dim when Pressed.

**Disclaimer:** this may work, but can also have ambigious layout due to hidden layout constraints in UIButton. Your best bet is to add subviews for a new imageView and titleLabel that you can have full control on the layout. (i.e. customImageView, customTitleView).
