CustomUIButtoniOS7
==================

Create a custom UIButton on iOS 7.0 that will Dim when Pressed. It changes NSLayoutConstraints on the button's UIImageView.

Don't judge the button on how it looks, it's fully functional and ready for real artwork. The set of screenshots show the normal 
and highlight state for a custom UIButton.
